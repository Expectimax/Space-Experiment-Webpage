                                Welcome to this experiment. This webpage is designed to conduct an experiment for my Master Thesis.
                                I have two different research questions. On one hand I want to see how humans interpret the different perspectives
                                on Space in modern information system research. On the other hand I want to study how humans cooperate
                                with an AI when they work together with one.

                                <br/> For this, I designed <strong>four different tasks</strong> which are connected to
                                <strong>four different perspectives on Space</strong><br/>
                                In each task the participants has to solve 12 image classification tasks (You will see an image,
                                and you have to guess to which category it belongs to). Overall there are four different groups.
                                You will be randomly assigned to one. The four groups are:
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                - <strong>the baseline group:</strong>
                                <br/>
                                You will work by yourself and won't cooperate with the AI.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                - <strong>the human-delegate group:</strong>
                                <br/>
                                You will have the possibility to delegate tasks to the AI. You will not see how the AI performs.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                - <strong>the feedback group:</strong>
                                <br/>
                                You will have the possibility to delegate tasks to the AI and you will see how the AI performs.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                - <strong>the ai-delegate group:</strong>
                                <br/>
                                You will only see pictures that the AI has delegated to you.
                                You cannot delegate, and you won't see how the AI performs.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                - <strong>the other user delegation group</strong>
                                <br/>
                                You will be able to delegate to the AI, and you will see how often other users have
                                delegated a specific image to the AI.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                The details of the different tasks will be explained once you get to the respective page.
                                Once you are ready, click the button below. It will redirect you to a page where you have to answer
                                a couple of short questions about yourself. After this, the experiment will start.
                                <br/>Thank you very much for your participation!<br/>
